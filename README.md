* This example shows how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer learning and Tensorflow.js.

* TensorFlow.js is a library for machine learning in JavaScript

* we have used a pretrained MobileNet model and train another model using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 4 different classes from the webcam defined by the user.
